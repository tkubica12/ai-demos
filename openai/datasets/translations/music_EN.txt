Typical triad in western music consist of interval above root being a minor third (three semitones) or major third (four semitones) and perfect fifth (seven semitones). Using diminished fifth or augmented fifth is possible, but less common in popular music. Common chord progression in jazz is succession o chords whose roots descend in fifths from the second degree (supertonic) to the fifth degree (dominant), and finally to the tonic. In a major key, the supertonic triad (ii) is minor, and in a minor key it is diminished. The dominant is, in its normal form, a major triad and commonly a dominant seventh chord.

We loved it and would return to this hotel. As a family of 3, we had a wonderful comfortable stay.

The breakfast lounge had many options that rotated each day. Very happy with the selection considering this was included in our hotel cost. Especially fruits were very tasty and our son enjoyed freshly cooked pancakes. The room was a great size and beds comfortable. The location was amazing! Right across from Bryant Park, close to all transit options.

This is hotel with 37 floors and there was often a wait for the elevators. If you have a room on an upper level, you can expect many stops to get down. If you are on a middle floor, the elevator may be full when it gets to you. As usual in modern hotels windows could not been open and we missed a little bit of fresh air.

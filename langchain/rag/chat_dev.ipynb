Configure a network security group\\n\\nWhen you connect your lab plan to a virtual network, you need to configure a network security group (NSG) to allow inbound RDP/SSH traffic from the user's computer to the template virtual machine and the lab virtual machines. An NSG contains access control rules that allow or deny traffic based on traffic direction, protocol, source address and port, and destination address and port. \\n\\nThe rules of an NSG can be changed at any time, and changes are applied to all associated instances. It might take up to 10 minutes for the NSG changes to be effective.\\n\\n> [!IMPORTANT]\\n> If you don't configure a network security group, you won't be able to access the lab template VM and lab VMs via RDP or SSH.\\n\\nThe network security group configuration for advanced networking consists of two steps:\\n\\n1. Create a network security group that allows RDP/SSH traffic\\n1. Associate the network security group with the virtual network subnet\\n\\n[!INCLUDE [nsg intro](../../includes/virtual-networks-create-nsg-intro-include.md)]\\n\\nYou can use an NSG to control traffic to one or more virtual machines (VMs), role instances, network adapters (NICs), or subnets in your virtual network. An NSG contains access control rules that allow or deny traffic based on traffic direction, protocol, source address and port, and destination address and port. The rules of an NSG can be changed at any time, and changes are applied to all associated instances.\\n\\nFor more information about NSGs, visit [what is an NSG](/azure/virtual-network/network-security-groups-overview).\\n\\n### Create a network security group to allow traffic\\n\\nFollow these steps to create an NSG and allow inbound RDP or SSH traffic:\\n\\n1. If you don't have a network security group yet, follow these steps to [create a network security group (NSG)](/azure/virtual-network/manage-network-security-group).\\n\\n    Make sure to create the network security group in the same Azure region as the virtual network and lab plan.\", metadata={'source': 'articles/lab-services/how-to-connect-vnet-injection.md', 'file_path': 'articles/lab-services/how-to-connect-vnet-injection.md', 'file_name': 'how-to-connect-vnet-injection.md', 'file_type': '.md'}),\n",

In order to configure two Azure Virtual Networks in two different regions to communicate with each other you need to  Install Azure Web Services  and we need to add  many-access authentication rules to our VM.
An example of how to do this would be to test .NET 8.0 and .NET Core 5.0 deployments.
In the wizard, see "Add an Azure Active Directory Server" , we set UPnP to our new virtual environment as shown above.
Add an In-Memory Windows Distributed Machine (DDLMS) Deployment
Connect to our virtual local environment and create an Azure Active Directory Server (AD DS).
Create an Azure Active Directory Server (AD DS) in this Azure domain.
Click Create.
Make sure to set up Windows PowerShell to participate in this step.
In the "Administrative" tab at the top of the file, see "Language X".
Create an Azure Active Directory Server (AD DS) in this Azure domain.
Use the "Advanced" tab to use the Azure Active Directory Services (AD DS) feature.
Site schema auto-update
Click Install.
Create a new database schema for your domain's admin.ps1.
In the "Administrative" tab, click Create a new database schema.
In the new database schema window, select the Active Directory Server feature from the drop-down menu.
Next, select Create/Deploy the new SQL Server database.
To deploy settings, we need a .UpdateUpdate script.

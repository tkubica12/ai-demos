In order to configure two Azure Virtual Networks in two different regions to communicate with each other you need to   *download the Azure Virtual Networks created in the other region* 
      *create a second cluster in the other region* 
      *then create a virtual private network between the two clusters** | 
      *then connect the two clusters* 
      *then create an Azure virtual network between each cluster* 
      *then create a firewall between the two clusters* 
      *then configure the network between the cluster services* 
      

**Fetch Azure Virtual Networks CSV: https://azure.microsoft.com/azure/powershell/azure-cluster-configuration/azure-virtual-network-configuration-from-csv.log

## Next steps

Now that you have a blueprint to create two Azure virtual networks, you can build out the network with virtual private networks and firewalls, just like you did with the two clusters.

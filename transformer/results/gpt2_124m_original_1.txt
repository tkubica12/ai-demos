In order to configure two Azure Virtual Networks in two different regions to communicate with each other you need to  Install Azure Web Services  and we need to add  many-access authentication rules to our VM.
An example of how to do this would be to test .NET 8.0 and .NET Core 5.0 deployments.
In the wizard, see "Add an Azure Active Directory Server" , we set UPnP to our new virtual environment as shown above.
Add an In-Memory Windows Distributed Machine (DDLMS) Deployment
Connect to our virtual local environment and create an Azure Active Directory Server (AD DS).
Create an Azure Active Directory Server (AD DS) in this Azure domain.
Click Create.
Make sure to set up Windows PowerShell to participate in this step.
In the "Administrative" tab at the top of the file, see "Language Setup" , in this section we will make sure that "Your Computer" is installed in the ASV line.
Click Start in the Windows PowerShell window.
Add a virtual network module's license symbol to the domain's license list.
Click On Azure Active Directory Server Domain.
Enter your Azure Active Directory Server IP for your distributed network's IP address.
Type the following code.
In the Azure Active Directory Server License box, in the "Authorization" box, enter your Windows PowerShell license symbol.
In the "Network" box, right click on the Network Module License box, and select "Add License Symbols…"
